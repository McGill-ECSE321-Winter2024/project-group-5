# ECSE 321 SportPlus Project: Group 5

## Project Overview

This project is an app to manage different classes and schedules within SportPlus sports center.

  The project's scope encompasses the development of a web application for a local sport center, catering to the needs of the owner, instructors, and customers. The application will feature distinct roles, including the owner, responsible for managing sport center information, approving new classes, adjusting schedules, and overseeing instructors; instructors, who can propose and supervise classes, update schedules, and seek approval for new class types; and customers, who can view class schedules, instructor details, register for sessions, and manage their registrations. 
  
  The system will support three predefined classes—cardio, stretching, and strength training—and allow instructors to propose new class types for owner approval. Scheduling capabilities will be provided, allowing instructors to update schedules for approved classes, while the owner has the authority to modify overall sport center schedules. Each stakeholder will have their own account for managing specific aspects, and the entire functionality will be accessible through a web frontend. 
  
  The development will be undertaken by the six students named below and will be organized into teams, covering requirements gathering, design, implementation, validation.
